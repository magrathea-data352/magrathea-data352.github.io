    <p><strong>According to the author, the community encompasing the SIGCSE review process is not spared from the prevalence of white supremacy and elitist ideals, which becomes evident to the author when their pannel proposal is regected. </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Feedback and the peer review process are very important, but only when done in a fair way devoid of bias. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It seems that each reviewer had different expectations from the author and little collaboration was done wnile writing reviews, leading to sometimes conflicting reviews. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There were many reviewer responses that, while logical, did not fail to meet any rules or conditions for the proposal, and should not have been used in reasoning for a regection. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The author gives several explanations as to why the reviewe responses do not make sense or are purely wrong, but did not give any hard evidence (exerpts from the proposal perhaps) in support of their claim. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Overall I felt that the reviewer responses were vague and lacking any kind of usefulness, In the future It may be best practice for reviewers to highlight specific criticisms of the proposal and provide specific exerpts of what they think needs changing.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> The author used the word "elitism" several times to describe many of the review responses and also the SIGCSE as a whole, and while there were one or two responses that did seem very problematic, I am not completley convinced that it "demonstrated they lack any understanding of identity, identity-inclusive computing", but I am not an expert in that field so I agknowledge the nuances that may be present.  </p>
    <br>
    <p> It is very important for professionals in the field to be present in panels regarding k-12 CS education rather than replacing them with someone who has a Phd but no experience in that field. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Problematic regection of proposals such as this only serve to slow down the progress made for inclusivity in the CS field. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Overall the blog post is very unprofessional and reads as more of a adollescent rant than a proper academic response.
