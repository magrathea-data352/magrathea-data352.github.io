    <p><strong>According to the author, the community encompasing the SIGCSE review process is not spared from the prevalence of white supremacy and elitist ideals, which becomes evident to the author when their pannel proposal is regected</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Feedback and the peer review process are very important, but only when done in a fair way devoid of bias</p>
    <br>
    <p>It seems that each reviewer had different expectations from the author and little collaboration was done wnile writing reviews, leading to sometimes conflicting reviews. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There were many reviewer responses that, while logical, did not fail to meet any rules or conditions for the proposal, and should not have been used in reasoning for a regection </p>
    <br>
    <p>The author gives several explanations as to why the reviewe responses do not make sense or are purely wrong, but did not give any hard evidence (exerpts from the proposal perhaps) in support of their claim</p>
