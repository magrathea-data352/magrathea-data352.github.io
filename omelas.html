    <p><strong>The focus on the emotional and psycological reprocussions of the cities decision to take advantage of the child makes clear the importance of considering the human costs of societal actions and the ways our moral choices affect people. </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>1. The story seems to be a critique on utilitarianism and the notion that majority happiness justifies minority suffering.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The story's use of a child as a sacrifice raises the question of the role of innocence and vulnerability in our moral decision-making. </p>
    <br>
    <p>3. A question is raised as to whether people who walk away from Omelas are moraaly "right" because while they may not be benefitting off the suffering of the child, they are still doing nothing to change the status quo.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The story almost forces readers to think to themselves on whether they would save the child or not. One must ask, would causing the disruption of a "utopia" be worth one childs freedom?</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. The story does a good job, I think, of making readers look at utilitarianism from both sides, and concede that while its wrong to imprison the child, free the child is not as "black and white" as it may seem. </p>
    <br>
    <p>6. I think its interesting how the society knows of the suffering of the child, and even holds school tours to visit the child. The lack of ignorance on account of the society complicates the utilitarianism a bit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. It is also a good example of how majority rule is not perfect, and often results in the oppression of the minority, or in this case the child.</p>
    <br>
    <p>8. A question is raised as to if the situation would be different if instead of forcing a random child to suffer, a sacrifice is volunteered?</p>
    <br>
    <p>9. Are those that walk away morally better than those that stay? Are those that stray morrally lesser than those who leave?</p>
    <br>
    <p>10. Similarly to the last one, would those who walk away almost be considered selfish since they are only acting to ease their conciousness and not actually helping the child.</p>
    <br>
    <p>11. The stories emphasis on how community shapes our morals and values highlights how we as a society need to keep ourselves in check.</p>
    <br>
    <p>12. The story raises the question of whether happiness requires suffering to exist, and if so to what extent?</p>
    <br>
    <p>13. The story's use of a child as the center of the suffering illistrates how innocence and vulnerability are often linked with moral-decision making.</p>
    <br>
    <p>14. The ambiguous ending of the story leaces readers wondering what the consequences of their own actions are, and what other suffering they may have caused.</p>
    <br>
    <p>15. Overall the story does a good job at forcing the reader to take a mental step back and wonder what suffering is currently happining for the happiness that readers are enjoying themselves.</p>
