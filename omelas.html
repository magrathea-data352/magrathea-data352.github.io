    <p><strong>The focus on the emotional and psycological reprocussions of the cities decision to take advantage of the child makes clear the importance of considering the human costs of societal actions and the ways our moral choices affect people. </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>1. The story seems to be a critique on utilitarianism and the notion that majority happiness justifies minority suffering.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The story's use of a child as a sacrifice raises the question of the role of innocence and vulnerability in our moral decision-making. </p>
    <br>
    <p>3. A question is raised as to whether people who walk away from Omelas are moraaly "right" because while they may not be benefitting off the suffering of the child, they are still doing nothing to change the status quo.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The story almost forces readers to think to themselves on whether they would save the child or not. One must ask, would causing the disruption of a "utopia" be worth one childs freedom?</p>
    <br>
    <p>5. The story does a good job, I think, of making readers look at utilitarianism from both sides, and concede that while its wrong to imprison the child, free the child is not as "black and white" as it may seem. </p>
    <br>
    <p>6. I think its interesting how the society agnolages the suffering of the child, and even holds school tours to visit the child. The lack of ignorance on account of the society complicates things the utilitarianism a bit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. It is also a good example of how majority rule is not perfect, and often results in the oppression of the minority, or in this case the child.</p>
