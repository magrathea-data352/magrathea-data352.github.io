    <p><strong>The lack of diversity and education in programming studios results in situations where things such as black hair are misrepresented, and leave little for the black community to connect with when compared with more straight hairstyles that are promenant in vieogames.   </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>1. Character creation tools have not come as far when compared to how videogames have advanced in production size and budgets.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Black hairstyles are just as --if not more-- diverse than any other ethnic group, yet the hairstyles present in most videogames for black hair is limited to just afros or cornrows. </p>
    <br>
    <p>3. One reason for the disparage in black hair is that some game companies in more eastern countries dont have access to diverse dev. teams, and lack education in black hairstyles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. Discrimination of black hairstyles is a very large problem in both schools and the workplace, and any attempts to normalise them, especially for youth playing videogames, are important. </p>
    <br>
    <p>5. Western beauty standards keep black hairstyles stigmatised in order to discriminate against black people, and this goes all the way back to slavery.</p>
    <br>
    <p>6. The over representation of white male protagonist and character creation tools built for white hair purpetuates the notion that videogames is just a space for white, male players.</p>
    <br>
    <p>7. The portrayel of blavk hairstyles as "exotic" is extremely harmful and contributes to the marginalisation of black players. </p>
    <br>
    <p>8. The use of black hair as an excuse for game developers to say they are "diverse" allows them to neglect diversity in all other aspects of the games. </p>
    <br>
    <p>9. Even games that put a lot of effort into diversifying hairstyles, like Horisons new dawn, still take shortcuts and utilise white hair textures to make black hair styles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>10. Street fighter did a good job of using an ethically accurate hairstyle to be the main  </p>
    <br>
    <p>11. Sometimes, audiences need to put pressure on game studios to add better examples of black hair, with big examples being GTA VI and the SIMS. </p>
    <br>
    <p>12. White game developers can search instagrsm ort the internet for black hairdtyles, but It is difficult to know what hairstyles are "in" when you are not part of that culture.</p>
    <br>
    <p>13. Blessing mentions several times not to spread hate to game developers because making these games are dificult, and the lack of diversity in hairstyles is a problem of ingnorance, not maliciousness. </p>
    <br>
    <p>14. The best way to tackle the lack of diversisity in game development is to hire more inclusive programmers and game developers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>15. We as the audience of these games must force game developers to do better by praising good examples of black hair and colling on other game companies to do better.</p>
