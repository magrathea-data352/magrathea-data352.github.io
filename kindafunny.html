    <p><strong>The lack of diversity and education in programming studios results in situations where things such as black hair are misrepresented, and leave little for the black community to connect with when compared with more straight hairstyles that are promenant in vieogames.   </strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Character creation tools have not come as far when compared to how videogames have advanced in production size and budgets.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Black hairstyles are just as --if not more-- diverse than any other ethnic group, yet the hairstyles present in most videogames for black hair is limited to just afros or cornrows. </p>
    <br>
    <p>One reason for the disparage in black hair is that some game companies in more eastern countries dont have access to diverse dev. teams, and lack education in black hairstyles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Discrimination of black hairstyles is a very large problem in both schools and the workplace, and any attempts to normalise them, especially for youth playing videogames, are important. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Western beauty standards keep black hairstyles stigmatised in order to discriminate against black people, and this goes all the way back to slavery.</p>
